## Automated Security Imaging Repository

This repository is a snapshot of the Automated Security Imaging project, focusing on the implementation of Mask-RCNN with an attention mechanism. The primary objective was to classify prohibited objects detected during security scanning using the GDXray and OPIXray datasets, ultimately aiming to automate security imaging processes.

### Model Performance
- Accuracy: 92.34%
- Precision: 0.87

### Datasets
The GDXray and OPIXray datasets used in this project can be downloaded [here](https://domingomery.ing.puc.cl/material/gdxray/).
